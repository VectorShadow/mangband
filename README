This is the README file for MAngband 0.7.2 (1/9/2003)

	The long sleep is ended.  This release concentrates almost entirely on 
bugfixes, and a few essential user interface issues.  0.72 has been 4 months in 
the making.  Emphasis was given to heavy testing, and playtesting every change.
Given a solid base, now we can build.

	The mangband 0.7.2 release does not change any major gameplay feature, 
however, many minor modifications are included.  Among those are:

  * Uniques cycle *much* faster.  This is required on busy servers.

  * house keys, and artifacts, can no longer simply get "lost" in the game.

  * Players no longer drop keys on death.  The ghost carries them.

  * Level Scumming is now matched to client preferences (be careful!)

  * Logging has been vastly upgraded.  In fact, you may find it's too verbose.
    to fix this, edit src/server/util.c (msg_print), and adjust as you see fit.

  * a massive number of server crash issues were fixed.  The list is too long
    to itterate, but server uptime (even on busy servers) now exceeds many days

  * Level 1 players have many restrictions on their interaction with other
    players.  This was done to reduce cheating.

  * ServerChez, and DM have been combined into a single character.  To enable this
    you have to define the DM character's nick in mangband.cfg.  No default is provided
    because I kept having nightmares about new servers being attacked this way.

  * Prices have been adjusted for several object types.  These adjustments
    were made to both reflect, and in some cases, offset rarity.  All of these
    changes are in lib/game/*.txt.  

  * Ghosts can no longer go down.  (reverse this in src/cmd/cmd1.c)

  * Maimum mode is now enabled by default.  If you don't like it, remove it.
    (src/server/birth.c, look for "p_ptr->maximize").  Note that clients
    from existing games will automatically be upgraded on first join unless
    you fix this first. (and they'll incur a double-penalty/bonus too!)

  * undefined messages are now silently ignored by the server

  * The windows client has been standardized on the msvc version.  Full source
    code (including MSVC workbench information) is in src/msvc.  The windows
    client should build out of the box, and operate fine.

  * the MSVC gamma has been fixed.

  * A latency measuring device has been added to the client.  This works 
    automatically on servers running the matching code (included in this release).

  * Many client fixes were made.  

  * The windows client now features the stand-alone chat dialog box (ala IRC)

  * all clients now feature multi-color messages (Code shamelessly stolen from 
    GRK's MSVC modifications)

  * several security fixes were applied to client messages, and the mangconsole

  * many other, more subtle fixes.  Some might not be universally accepted, however, they
    have all been thouroughly playtested on mangband.org, and seem to work well in 
    combination to create a nice, playable game.

This is the README file for MAngband 0.7.0 (1/6/2001)

	After many months in beta the stable version MAngband 0.7.0 has finally
been released.  The major goal in creating version 0.7.0 has been to make the
game as smooth and responsive as possible.  To do this the network and timing
code has been reworked.  As a result MAngband 0.7.0 is not backwards compatible
with previous versions of the game : to play on a 0.7.0 server, you need a
0.7.0 or later client, and the 0.7.0 client will not work on any servers older
than version 0.7.0.
	Unfortunately, as in version 0.6.1, the server is still a bit unstable,
and occasionally receives a segmentation fault.  In the case that this happens,
the server will try its best to save everything before crashing.  If you plan
on running a 0.7.0 server, I recommend using something such as the included
runserv script which will immediately restart the server when it crashes. 
	Many people have contributed to MAngband 0.7.0.  Thanks to Crimson
(crimson@pobox.com) for his various code additions, Warrior
(mangband@hotmail.com) for his ego item suggestions, Dark God
(darkgod@ifrance.com) for his ego item patch, Toshi Tanaka
(t-tanaka@kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp) for his client setup patch, and Lee
(adamson@csee.wvu.edu) for his report_address patch.

	Have fun, and good luck!

	-Alex


New in .7.0 : (for a complete list of changes check the ChangeLog)

  * The networking code has been modified to use TCP instead of UDP.  Because
    of this all commands sent from the client are guaranteed to be performed
    on the server.  Because of this and other changes, players should also
    experience a much smoother game.

  * Many new items and ego items have been added to the game.

  * Shops should change their inventories much faster.

  * The mage spell GOI no longer stacks.

  * More mangband.cfg server options have been added.
 
  * Many bug fixes.


	Please send bug reports, questions, or any other feedback to the
maintainer (adingle@crud.net), or to the mangband-d mailing list
(mangband-d@crud.net).  Archives of the mailing list can be found at
http://www.crud.net/Lists-Archives/.


=== MAngband Information ===
	
Every server reports to a metaserver running at mangband.org.  To ask questions
about it, send mail to adingle@crud.net.  To see a list of servers running and the
number of people playing on each of them, telnet to mangband.org at port
8801 (for example, type "telnet mangband.org 8801").  It should give you
a list of servers with number of people on each.

Visit the MAngband Home Page "http://www.mangband.org" for
more information about recent changes and improvements, and links to binarys
of the client and server for various platforms.

If you are only going to use the client, the "lib" directories do not need
to be installed anywhere.  However, to use the "pref files", you must install
the "lib/user" directory correctly.

If you are going to run a server, the "lib" directories must be installed
in the location pointed to in "config.h" and must be readable/writable by
the owner of the server process.

Most of the networking code was borrowed from the game "XPilot", and then
heavily modified by myself.  Because XPilot is placed under the GNU
General Public License, those portions of MAngband are also placed under
that license.  A copy of the License is included in the source distribution
as the file "COPYING".



=== General Information ===

MAngband is a "graphical" dungeon adventure game using textual characters
to represent the walls and floors of a dungeon and the inhabitants therein,
in the vein of "rogue", "hack", "nethack", and "moria".  MAngband differs
from normal Angband in that more than one human player inhabits this
dungeon, and the players can interact in peaceful or violent ways.

There are extensive ascii "on line help" files in the "lib/help" directory.

This version of MAngband will only work on Unix (X11/Curses), Linux 
(X11/Curses), and similar platforms that are UNIX-ish.  However, this 
version has only been tested extensively on a Linux machine.  It has been
tested and compiles and works on SGI's, HP-UX, and Sun's, however.

See Makefile, h-config.h, and config.h for details on compiling.

Visit the MAngband Home Page ("http://www.mangband.org") and
browse through the Angband newsgroup ("rec.games.roguelike.angband").

Send bug reports, suggestions, etc, to Alex Dingle ("adingle@crud.net").


=== Quick and dirty compilation instructions (for Unix/Linux) === 

Step 1: Acquire.  Use a web browser to acquire the source at
                  "http://www.mangband.org/download/.
Step 2: Extract.  Try "gunzip *.gz" then "tar -xvf *.tar"
Step 3: Prepare.  Try "cd mangband*/src", then edit "Makefile"
                  You should also edit "h-config.h" and "config.h"
Step 4: Compile.  Try "make", and then "cd .." if successful
Step 5: Execute.  Try "mangclient keldon.student.umr.edu" to connect
                  to a server running on my personal machine.
Step 6: Play....  Read the "online help" via the "?" command.



=== Directory "src" ===

The "src" directory contains the complete set of source files.

The "src" directory has two subdirectories. The "server" directory
contains the source for the MAngband server, and the "client" directory
contains the client source.

The "main-???.c" and "Makefile.???" in the "client" directory may
eventually allow compilation on various systems.

Some of these systems (Macintosh, Windows) require "extra" files, most of
which are located elsewhere (except for the "A-mac-h.*" Macintosh files).


=== Directory "lib" ===

The "lib" directory contains all of MAngband's special sub-directories.


=== Directory "lib/apex" ===

The "lib/apex" directory contains the "high score" files.

The "scores.raw" file contains the "high score" table, in a "semi-binary" form,
that is, all the bytes in the file are normal ascii values, but this includes
the special "nul" or "zero" byte, which is used to separate and pad records.
You should probably not attempt to modify this file with a normal text editor.
This file should be (more or less) portable between different platforms.  It
must be present (or creatable) for the game to run correctly.


=== Directory "lib/bone" ===

The "lib/bone" directory contains special "player ghost" template files.

The files in this directory have filenames of the form "bone.NNN" where
"NNN" is the level on which the player died.  They contain information
about the dead player, currently, one line each for the player name,
maximum hitpoints, race, and class.  These files are probably portable,
and are probably compatible with older bone files, if those files are
renamed, and a final newline is added for compatibility.  Actually,
only the "player name" from these files is actually used.


=== Directory "lib/data" ===

The "lib/data" directory contains various special binary data files.

The files 'f_info.raw', 'k_info.raw', 'a_info.raw', 'e_info.raw', 'r_info.raw',
and 'v_info.raw' are binary image files constructed by parsing the ascii
template files in "lib/edit", described below.  These files are required,
but can be created by the game if the "lib/edit" directory contains the
proper files, and if the game was compiled to allow this creation.


=== Directory "lib/edit" ===

The "lib/edit" directory contains various special ascii data files.

The files 'f_info.txt', 'k_info.txt', 'a_info.txt', 'e_info.txt', 'r_info.txt',
and 'v_info.txt' are ascii template files used to construct the binary image
files in "lib/data", described above.  These files describe the "terrain
features", "object kinds", "artifacts", "ego-items", "monster races", and
"dungeon vaults", respectively.

The ascii template files are easier to edit than hard-coded arrays, and also
prevent compilation errors on some machines, and also shrink the size of the
binary executable, and also provide a user-readible spoiler file of sorts.

These files are optional if the game is distributed with pre-created
binary raw files in "lib/data".


=== Directory "lib/file" ===

The "lib/file" directory contains various special ascii data files.

The 'news.txt' file is displayed to the user when the game starts up.  It
contains basic information such as my name and email address, and the names
of some of the people who have been responsible for previous versions of
Angband.  You may edit this file (slightly) to include local "site specific"
information such as who compiled the local executable.  You should refer the
user to a special "online help" file, if necessary, that describes any local
modifications in detail.  The first two lines of this file should be blank,
and only the next 20 lines should contain information.

The 'dead.txt' file is displayed to the user when the player dies.  It
contains a picture of a tombstone which is filled in with interesting
information about the dead player.  You should not edit this file.

The optional file 'wizards.txt' may be used to specify which users may enter
'wizard' mode.  A missing file provides no restrictions, and an empty file
prevents everyone from entering 'wizard' mode.  This file is only used on
multi-user machines, otherwise there are no restrictions.

The optional file 'time.txt' may be used to restrict the "times" at which
the game may be played, by providing specification of which hours of each day
of the week are legal for playing the game.  See 'files.c' for more details.
A missing file provides no restrictions, and an empty file will, by default,
forbid the playing of the game from 8am-5pm on weekdays.  This file is only
used on multi-user machines, and only if CHECK_TIME is defined, otherwise,
there are no restrictions.

The optional file 'load.txt' may be used to restrict the "load" which the game
may impose on the system.  See 'files.c' for more details.  A missing file
provides no restrictions, and an empty file will, by default, restrict the
"current load" to a maximal value of 100*FSCALE.  This file is only used on
multi-user machines, and only if CHECK_LOAD is defined, otherwise, there are
no restrictions.


=== Directory "lib/help" ===

The "lib/help" directory contains the "online help" files.

This directory is used to search for normal "on line help" files.


=== Directory "lib/info" ===

The "lib/info" directory (optional) contains the "spoiler" files.

This directory is used to search for any "on line help" file that cannot
be found in the "lib/help" directory.

The user may "redirect" this directory to point at any available directory.

Note that the default "help.hlp" file allows the "9" key to access a help
file called "spoiler.hlp", and allows the "0" key to access "user.hlp".

These special help files can thus be placed in the user's own "info"
directory to allow the on line help to access his files.


=== Directory "lib/save" ===

The "lib/save" directory contains "savefiles" for the players.

Each savefile is named "NNN" where "NNN" is the name of the character.

The savefiles should be portable between systems, assuming that the
appropriate renaming is perfomed, and any file "type" information is
specified (for the Macintosh).  However, I must really recommend
against copying savefiles from one server to another, because this
could cause problems about having multiple artifacts on one server,
etc.  Don't do it.


=== Directory "lib/user" ===

The "lib/user" directory contains the "user pref files", if any.

In general, these files are used to "customize" aspects of the game for
a given site or a given player.  These files can define "macros" (which
allow a single keypress to perform a complex action), set options (which
affect how the game will handle various situations), and specify visual
mappings for various monsters, objects, or terrain features.

Many of these files are not read by the server, but most are read by
the client.

See "files.c" for more information on the proper "format" of these files.


=== Directory "lib/xtra" ===

The "lib/xtra" directory contains special system files, if any.
