# MAngband client configuration file (for *nix mangband 0.1.5 and later)

# Copy this file to your home directory and call it ".mangrc" after editing
# it.

# This file consists of "blocks" of information that are used for each
# server.  You can have a "default" that is used if no other block matches
# a server name.

# If you want a different set of information for a certain server, place
# another block of info around here.



# Note that the default block should appear after all other blocks.

server default

# Pick a name.  Spaces are allowed.  The name should be no longer than 15
# characters and shouldn't contain any "special" characters.

# shouldn't use a password that you use anywhere else, because it is not
# encrypted.

# Now, set the order that you want your stats to be.  The first number
# specifies the highest stat (most important) down to the lowest stat.
# This will be *before* plusses are added in.
#
# For example, a warrior might want:
#
# stat 1 5 4 3 2 6
#
# 1 - STR   2 - INT   3 - WIS   4 - DEX   5 - CON   6 - CHR

stat 1 2 3 4 5 6

# This marks the end of a server block

end
